# Lab3_matrix-sort
In the square matrix sort the columns in ascending order of the sums of their elements


# Lab4_delete-repetition
Enter a string data of arbitrary length, which will be interpreted as text in which, words are separated by one or more spaces (word length, in general, arbitrary). Assuming that in the given text repetition of words is possible, output all words in a column without repetitions. In the second column, print the frequency of use of the corresponding word.


# Lab5_find-route
Describe a structure named "MARSHRUT" containing the following fields:
- "Name of departure point of the route";
- "Name of destination route";
- "Route number".

Write a program to implement the following actions:
- Data entry into the array of structures such as "MARSHRUT" and sorting records by increasing the route number;
- Output of information about the route, the number of which is set by the user;
- Output of information about routes that start or end at the point named by the user;

If there are no such routes, display the corresponding message.


# Lab6_file-processing
The file containing phone numbers of employees of the organization is specified: 
- the surname and initials, 
- phone number are specified. 

Find the phone number of the employee by his last name and initials.


# Lab7_List-data-structures
In ascending order, print all integers in the range 1… 1000000, which are represented as 𝑘 = 𝑚^2 + 𝑛^2, where 𝑚> 0, 𝑛> 0.


# Lab8_verify_matrix_relationship
Develop procedures to verify that the relationship given by the matrix is a complete order relationship.


# Lab9_Generating-combinatorial-objects
Write a program for generating words that can be obtained by permutations of the first four letters of a given word. The input word is entered from the keyboard, and the letters in the word may be repeated.


# Lab10_verify-monotonic-function
Determine whether the given function is monotonic.


# Lab11_verify-connected-graph
Check that the graph specified by the K-list is connected.


# Lab12_grammars-generation
Theory of grammars and formal languages.

Grammar generates a sequence of relations of form:
- \<variable\> \<relation operation\> \<number\>

where:
- \<variable\> consists of letters and has an arbitrary length,
- \<relationship operation\>: \<\<\=\>\> \= \<\> \=
- \<number\> - an integer without a sign of arbitrary length.

The relations are separated from each other by commas, the comma cannot be after the last in the sequence of relations.
